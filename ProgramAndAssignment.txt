1 simple if:-

if condition:
  statements


2 multiple if

...

3 if--else
if condition:

4 nested if--else

  we can write more than one if--else statement in nested sequence.

if condition:
    if condition:
        statements
    else
       statements

else
     if condition:

WAP to check greatest number?
a=10
b=20
c=30





  
nested block always will be prefered when we want to discard logical operator.

WAP to calculate greatest number without using logical operator?


when multiple conditions apply in single program than nested block has complex structure hence elif block has implemented.


if  condition:
    statement

elif condition:
